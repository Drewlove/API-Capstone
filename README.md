Summary: The application allows users to create line graphs that view two different data sets about the USA. One, a graph that 
displays CO2 emissions generated by a specified state from 1980-2016. The user can view up to 5 states at a time, and can specify which energy types' CO2 emissions they wish to view. Two, the user can also view a ratio of CO2 emissions per state GDP.  


State GDP data is fetched with an API call to the Bureau of Economic Analysis:

State CO2 emission data is fetched with an API call to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's developer network:
